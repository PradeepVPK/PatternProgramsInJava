# Basic Java Pattern Programs

This repository contains a collection of basic Java programs to print different patterns. Each program is designed to demonstrate a specific pattern and is located in the `/src` directory. The programs are written in the `Main.java` file and other pattern-specific files, as follows:

- `Main.java`: Main file (entry point) for the Java pattern programs.
- `/src/_1_EQ_tri.java`: Program to print an equilateral triangle pattern.
- `/src/_2_inverted_tri.java`: Program to print an inverted triangle pattern.
- `/src/_3_box.java`: Program to print a square box pattern.
- `/src/_4_box_outline.java`: Program to print a square box pattern with outline.
- `/src/_5_box_x.java`: Program to print a square box pattern with X inside.
- `/src/_6_x.java`: Program to print an 'X' pattern.
- `/src/_7_right_tri.java`: Program to print a right-angled triangle pattern.
- `/src/_8_reverse_tri.java`: Program to print a reverse right-angled triangle pattern.
- `/src/_9_mirror_right.java`: Program to print a mirrored right-angled triangle pattern.
- `/src/_10_mirror_invert_tri.java`: Program to print a mirror-inverted triangle pattern.
- `/src/_11_diamond.java`: Program to print a diamond pattern.
- `/src/_12_diamnd_outline.java`: Program to print a diamond pattern with outline.
- `/src/_13_nubers_dismond.java`: Program to print a diamond pattern with numbers.
- `/src/_14_diamaond_char.java`: Program to print a diamond pattern with characters.
- `/src/_15_m_patteern.java`: Program to print the letter 'M' pattern.
- `/src/_16_seq_num.java`: Program to print a sequence of numbers pattern.

## How to Use

You can access the code by simply cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/PradeepVPK/C.git`

To run any of the Java pattern programs, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can compile and execute the programs using the following commands:

# Navigate to the /src directory
`cd PatternProgramsInJava/src`

# Compile the Java program
`javac Main.java`

# Run the Java program
`java Main`

Replace `Main.java` with the name of the specific Java file you want to compile and run.
